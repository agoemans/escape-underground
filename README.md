# Escape Underground

This project is a TypeScript-based application. The boilerplate code for this project was generated using GitHub Copilot.
This is just a prototype project, to play around with code generation for Google Copilot. I want to see how much boilerplate code can be generated for this game engine and how much I have to clean up/tweak. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/escape-underground.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd escape-underground
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## How to Run

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2. Run a local server (I use python http.server and then navigate to) `http://localhost:8080`.

## Scripts

- `npm run build`: Builds the project for development and production.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite.[to be set up]
